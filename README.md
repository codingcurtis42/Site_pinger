# Site_pinger

A tool to ping and report site connectivity status with a TKinter reporting. Also logs status in Site specific CSV file in the same directory (be sure to contain within a folder). Currently set for a linux environment, switch the -c at each sites ping to -n to use with windows. Unsure if works with Mac. 

# What I Learned 
This was my first python program, so I learnt a lot with it. opening and editting CSV's, TKinter, sys commands, datetime, basics of python.
